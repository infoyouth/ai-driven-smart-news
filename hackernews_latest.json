        "description": "Hi HN!<p>I\u2019ve always been a fan of application launchers, and I was impressed by the approach the Raycast team took \u2014 especially their extension system. About six months ago I started building something similar for Linux, aiming to integrate deeply at the OS level and give extensions a lot of power.<p>Vicinae is written in C++ with Qt Widgets. I chose Widgets over QML for more imperative control of the UI, especially around extension handling. So far that\u2019s worked well \u2014 modern C++ is great.<p>To support my goals I built a number of custom widgets, including a fully virtualized list that can efficiently render tens of thousands of items. That gave me a lot of respect for Qt \u2014 it\u2019s a powerful framework that mostly stayed out of my way.<p>A key feature is support for Raycast extensions (React + TypeScript), most of which can be installed and used directly inside the launcher (though not all features are implemented yet). There\u2019s also a native API package (@vicinae&#x2F;api) for writing Vicinae-specific extensions with additional capabilities. This required writing a custom React reconciler \u2014 surprisingly straightforward, though still unpolished.<p>Like Raycast, Vicinae ships with powerful built-in modules, but the goal isn\u2019t to make a clone. I want it to grow into its own project that fits the FOSS model better, while staying compatible with the Raycast ecosystem. I also plan to bring it to other OSes eventually.<p>I\u2019d love feedback on the technical approach, and suggestions for what would make this useful to you. Contributions are very welcome \u2014 I\u2019ve already been pleasantly surprised by how quickly people started helping.<p>Docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.vicinae.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.vicinae.com</a>\nRepo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vicinaehq&#x2F;vicinae\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vicinaehq&#x2F;vicinae</a>",
